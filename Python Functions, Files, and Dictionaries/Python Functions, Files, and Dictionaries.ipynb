    "As an example, suppose we have a text file called `olympics.txt` that contains the data representing about olympians across different years. The contents of the file are shown at the bottom of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "To `open` this file, we would call the open function. The variable, `fileref`, now holds a reference to the file object returned by open. When we are finished with the file, we can close it by using the `close` method. After the file is closed any further attempts to use `fileref` will result in an error.`"

    "we can illustrate how `file reading` works. Python provides some functions for reading data from an existing file. There are two steps. First, you call the `open` function to open the file. So, here we have an invocation of the open function, and we pass in two arguments. One is the string, that's the name of the file, Olympics.text. And the other says what to do with the file. In our case, `r` for reading. Later on, we'll see `w` for writing. The open function returns an object. It's a file object, and we are assigning it to this variable name called `fileref`. There's going to be an additional step that we're going to have to do to actually read the contents. So, this step that we're showing so far just creates the file object. Then, they're going to be some lines of code that we haven't written yet, that will actually get the contents from the file and do something with it. Then, there is a corresponding close operation that lets Python know that we're done working with this file object, and it's okay to stop keeping track of it. So, there's a line three, `fileref.close`. Now, if I run this, we're actually not going to see any output because all we've done is open the file and then close it. We haven't actually read the contents in, and we certainly haven't printed anything out, so you're not seeing anything in the output window. "

That returns a string, and I'm assigning that to the variable called `contents`, and then I can just print out, let's print out the first 100 characters of it. Now, we'll see something in the \"Output\" window. So, we're seeing the first 100 characters from the file, which got us three lines and a little bit of the fourth line. \n",

    "**There are a few things worth noting in the code above**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, using `.format()` makes it really clear what we’re doing when we create the variable `row_string`. We are making a comma separated set of values; the `{}` curly braces indicated where to substitute in the actual values. The equivalent `string concatenation` would be very hard to read. An alternative, also clear way to do it would be with the `.join method: row_string = ','.join(olympian[0], olympian[1], olympian[2])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, unlike the print statement, remember that the `.write()` method on a file object **does not automatically insert a newline. Instead, we have to explicitly add the character `('\\n')` at the end of each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Third, we have to explicitly refer to each of the elements of olympian when building the string to write. Note that just putting `.format(olympian)` **wouldn’t work** because the interpreter would see only one value (a tuple) when it was expecting three values to try to substitute into the string template. Later in the book we will see that python provides an advanced technique for automatically unpacking the three values from the tuple, with `.format(*olympian)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described previously, if one or more columns contain text, and that text could contain commas, we need to do something to distinguish a comma in the text from a comma that is separating different values (cells in the table). If we want to enclose each value in double quotes, it can start to get a little tricky, because we will need to have the double quote character inside the string output. But it is doable. Indeed, one reason Python allows strings to be delimited with either single quotes or double quotes is so that one can be used to delimit the string and the other can be a character in the string. If you get to the point where you need to quote all of the values, we recommend learning to use python’s csv module."

Let’s say you want a function that asks a yes-or-no question.

Here is a program that uses a `while` loop to keep asking until it receives a valid answer. As a preview of coming attractions, it uses the `upper()` method which is described in String Methods to convert a string to upper case.

    "Here, you’ll see one more way to invoke functions with optional parameters, **with keyword-based parameter passing.

    "The basic idea of passing arguments by keyword is very simple. When invoking a function, inside the parentheses there are always 0 or more values, separated by commas. With keyword arguments, some of the values can be of the form `paramname = <expr>` instead of just `<expr>`. Note that when you have `paramname = <expr>` in a function definition, it is defining the default value for a parameter when no value is provided in the invocation; when you have `paramname = <expr> `in the invocation, it is supplying a value, overriding the default for that paramname.\n"

Here, it’s pretty easy to compute that property. `states[state]` is the list of cities associated with a particular state. So If `state` is a list of city strings, `len(states[state][0])` is the length of the first city name. Thus, we can use a `lambda` expression:"

    "For our second sort order, the property we want to sort by is the number of cities that begin with the letter ‘S’. The function defining this property is harder to express, requiring a filter and count accumulation pattern. So we are better off defining a separate, named function. Here, we’ve chosen to make a lambda expression that looks up the value associated with the particular state and pass that value to the named function s_cities_count. We could have passed just the key, but then the function would have to look up the value, and it would be a little confusing, from the code, to figure out what dictionary the key is supposed to be looked up in. Here, we’ve done the lookup right in the lambda expression, which makes it a little bit clearer that we’re just sorting the keys of the states dictionary based on a property of their values. It also makes it easier to reuse the counting function on other city lists, even if they aren’t embedded in that particular states dictionary."
