    "\n",
    "* What sequence will you iterate through as you accumulate a result? \n",
    "It could be a range of numbers, the letters in a string, or some existing list that you have just as a list of names.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What type of value will you accumulate? \n",
    "    - If your final result will be a number, your accumulator will start out with a number and always have a number even as it is updated each time. \n",
    "    - Similarly, if your final result will be a list, start with a list. \n",
    "    - If your final result will be a string, you’ll probably want to start with a string; one other option is to accumulate a list of strings and then use the `.join()` method at the end to concatenate them all together."
