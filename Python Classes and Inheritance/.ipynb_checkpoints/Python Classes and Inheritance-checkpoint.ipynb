    "<h2> Constructing Classes </h2>\n",
    "<h3>  Introduction: Classes and Objects - The Basics </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an __object-oriented programming language__. That means it provides features that support object-oriented programming (__OOP__).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasn’t until the mid 1980s that it became the main programming paradigm used in the creation of new software. It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly increasing size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier to modify these large and complex systems over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, some of the programs we have been writing use a procedural programming paradigm. In procedural programming the focus is on writing functions or procedures which operate on data. __In object-oriented programming the focus is on the creation of objects which contain both data and functionality together__. Usually, each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, every value is actually an object. Whether it be a dictionary, a list, or even an integer, they are all objects. Programs manipulate those objects either by performing computation with them or by asking them to perform methods. To be more specific, we say that an object has a state and a collection of methods that it can perform. (More about methods below.) The state of an object represents those things that the object knows about itself. The state is stored in instance variables. For example, as we have seen with turtle objects, each turtle has a state consisting of the turtle’s position, its color, its heading and so on. Each turtle also has the ability to go forward, backward, or turn right or left. Individual turtles are different in that even though they are all turtles, they differ in the specific values of the individual state attributes (maybe they are in a different location or have a different heading).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> User Defined Classes </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve already seen classes like str, int, float and list. These were defined by Python and made available for us to use. However, in many cases when we are solving problems we need to create data objects that are related to the problem we are trying to solve. We need to create our own classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand what a `point` object might look like, we can define a new class. We’ll want our points to each have an `x` and a `y` attribute, so our first class definition looks like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Point:\n",
    "    \"\"\" Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\" Create a new point at the origin \"\"\"\n",
    "        self.x = 0\n",
    "        self.y = 0\n",
    "Class definitions can appear anywhere in a program, but they are usually near the beginning (after the `import` statements). The syntax rules for a class definition are the same as for other compound statements. There is a header which begins with the keyword, `class`, followed by the name of the class, and ending with a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first line after the class header is a string, it becomes the docstring of the class, and will be recognized by various tools. (This is also the way docstrings work in functions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every class should have a method with the special name `__init__`. This __initializer method__, often referred to as the constructor, is automatically called whenever a new instance of `Point` is created. It gives the programmer the opportunity to set up the attributes required within the new instance by giving them their initial state values. The `self` parameter (you could choose any other name, but nobody ever does!) is automatically set to reference the newly created object that needs to be initialized.\n"

There is a way to define a default sort order for instances, right in the class definition, but it requires defining a bunch of methods or one complicated method, so we won’t bother with that. Instead, you should just provide a key function as a parameter to sorted (or sort).\n",

So it is exactly the kind of function we need to provide as the key parameter for sorted.

The reason we make a copy of the list is that we will perform destructive operations (appending new sounds to the list).
